# Data Sources

All GIS files are pulled from the [US Census website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). Since the website format and its contents changes quite frequently, the data sources are pulled here. Note these are the precincts shape files from **2018**.

All CSV files containing demographic/voter are pulled from the [IRE Census Bulk Data Website](http://census.ire.org/data/bulkdata.html). Note the population comes from **2010**.

All JSON files contain GIS polygon data, as well as their unique identifiers.

- [JSON]()

## [Washington]() (Cleaned, 99 precincts, 4 districts)
*Note: [Iowa State constitution](http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-7.html) Article III, Section 37 mandates that the districts respect county boundaries. Thus a map of counties was generated by dissolving along the COUNTYFP field.*
