# Data Sources

All GIS files are pulled from the [US Census website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). Since the website changes quite frequently, the data sources are pulled here. They are then cleaned and put into this repo.

All CSV files containing demographic/voter are pulled from state sites. Below are each of their respective sources, issues with the dataset and potential missing data.

All JSON files contain GIS polygon data, as well as their unique identifiers.

# Notation

## GIS Files
As noted in the [US Census](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/2018_file_name_def.pdf), the following attributes are of paticular interest:

- `GEOID`: The US Census primary key, assigned to each US Census tract
- `STATEFP`: An integer identifier of a state
- `COUNTYFP`: An integer identifier of a county
- `NAME`: A string representing the human readable name of the region
- `ALAND`: An integer rerpesenting the area of land in the region
- `AWATER`: An intenger representing the area of water in the region

# State Files

## [Iowa]() (Cleaned, 99 precincts, 4 districts)
*Note: [Iowa State constitution](http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-7.html) Article III, Section 37 mandates that the districts respect county boundaries. Thus a map of counties was generated by dissolving along the COUNTYFP field.*
