# Data Sources

All GIS files are pulled from the [US Census website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). Since the website changes quite frequently, the data sources are pulled here. They are then cleaned and put into this repo.

All CSV files containing demographic/voter are pulled from state sites. Below are each of their respective sources, issues with the dataset and potential missing data.

All JSON files contain GIS polygon data, as well as their unique identifiers.

## [Iowa]() (Cleaned, 100 precincts, 4 districts)
*Note: [Iowa State constitution](http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-7.html) Article III, Section 37 mandates that the districts respect county boundaries. Thus a map of counties was generated by dissolving along the COUNTYFP field.*
